# hello-World
### Github Project MAGD 150
For this github project, I used labs 2, 4, and 6.
* **Lab 2:** Lab two was my solar system sketch where I used primitive shapes through [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create a solar system scene.
* **Lab 4:** Lab four was my snake project where I made movement and beginner logic for the character in the game snake through [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
* **Lab 6:** Lab six was my retro game project where I made a moveable character interact with a moving environment. This led to the character attempting to complete the course without running into any of the other objects. This was also made in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
